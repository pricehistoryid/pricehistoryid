## Features and Limitations

### Features

- **Supports Tokopedia product price tracking.** The extension is compatible with one of the largest Indonesian E-Commerce platform.
- **Price saved in your local storage.** The extension saves the prices of products directly to your local storage, ensuring that your data is kept private and is easily accessible on your device.
- **Display the historical prices captured on current device.** You can view the historical prices of products that have been captured on your current device, helping you make informed purchasing decisions based on past price trends.

### Limitations

- **Limited supported sites.** Currently the extension only supports few Indoensian E-Commerce platform.
- **The data is stored locally.** Meaning it is not synced across devices. However, we're currently developing the devices sync feature.
- **Local storage limitations.** The amount of historical data that can be stored is limited by the available space in your browser’s local storage, which is capped at 10MB. Large amounts of data might affect the extension’s performance.
- **Manual interaction required.** The extension relies on user interaction to capture the latest prices. It does not automatically update prices in the background or using bot, so you need to manually refresh or visit product pages to update the price history.
